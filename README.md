# Crypto Quant Trading App

Jesus walks on water! Simple and elegant crypto app showing quantitative and technical signals designed to reduce hours and hours of screen time by
providing the crypto community with an intuitive way to scan for opportunities in a systematic way.

Are you tired of non-intuitive scanners, which only show the current largest movers, but do now compare the move with historical moves or what the Bitcoin is doing? Instead of endless charting options which only confuse, the logic behind this app was the following: coins only go up, down or stay about the same.

Whether you are a short term scalper or a swing trader, you will benefit from having a complete overview over the whole binance universe of assets in one table, 
easily sortable by candle size, volume, volatility extremes, trend strength and many more. You can also scan for
extremes relative to Bitcoin, as all major indicators are normalized to Bitcoin to show whether the market as a whole or only a specific coin is moving.
